# memosong

Memosong is a clone of the well known game Memory but I'm using musics instead of pictures.

Deezer API is used to get tracks http://developers.deezer.com/

This website is fully responsive (or at least i try to do it :-)

Would you want to test your memory ? Play now ! http://tictac.pm/memosong/

I wish you having fun !

## config

This is just a small static website.

All you need is a Deezer account with playlists (at least one playlist, each playlist must have at least 12 tracks available).

You must set your Deezer user id at the bottom of playlist.htm file.

    <!-- replace USERID by your deezer user id -->
    <script src="https://api.deezer.com/user/USERID/playlists&output=jsonp&callback=user_playlists"></script>
